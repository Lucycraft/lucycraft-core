/**
 * LUCYCRAFT-CORE
 *
 * Written by Boris Wintein & Glenn Latomme.
 * For Lucycraft - An Adventure/Survival RPG Server.
 *
 * This is a core website system for setting up websites for Minecraft-servers.
 *
 * For full functionality we suggest using bukkit (www.bukkit.org) and it's plugins instead of the vanilla
 * Minecraft server. This system currently supports only a few core plugins, but extensions and modules will
 * be available for extra functionality.
 *
 * Without bukkit, or any other modded Minecraft server this system loses a lot of functionality and basically
 * just turns in a CMS/Blog with useless modules. It will not break but gracefully tell you that you should
 * really use plugins. It's just more awesome.
